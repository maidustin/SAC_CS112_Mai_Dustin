4.11 Explain what happens when a Java program attempts to divide one integer by another. What happens to the fractional part of the calculation? How can you avoid that outcome?

When you divide one integer with another it will result in integer divison- the calculation's fractional part is lost 

4.12 Describe the two ways in which control statements can be combined.

Control-Statement stacking is the connection of the exit point of one to the entry point of the other. 
Control-Statement Nesting is when a control statement is inside another control statement.

4.13 What type of repetition would be appropriate for calculating the sum of the first 100 positive
integers?What type would be appropriate for calculating the sum of an arbitrary number of positive
integers? Briefly describe how each of these tasks could be performed.

Counter Controlled Repetition would be appropriate for calculating the sum of the first 100 positive integers.
It uses a counter to control the number of times a set of statements will execute.

Sentinel Controlled Repetition would be appropriate for calculating the sum of an arbitrary number of positive integers.
It uses a sentinel value to indicate the end of the data entry.
	
4.14 What is the difference between preincrementing and postincrementing a variable?

Preincrementing causes a variable to be incremented or decremented by 1; then the new value of the variable is used in the expression as how it is shown. 
Postincrementing the variable causes its value to be used in the expression in which it appears; then the variable's value is incremented or decremented by 1. 

4.15 Identify and correct the errors in each of the following pieces of code. [Note: There may be
more than one error in each piece of code.]

a)the quotation mark at the end of the second line should be inside the parenthesis

b) total is not assigned to anything. 

c) no opening or closing brace

d) No closed brace
